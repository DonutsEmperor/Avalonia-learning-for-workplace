# Music Store App

## Official tutorial of from https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/tutorials/music-store-app/

In this tutorial i will repeat a desktop app based on the idea of a music store. The app is highly graphical - it presents images of album covers, 
and uses semi-transparent 'acrylic' blurred window backgrounds to give a very up-to-date look. By the end of the tutorial, i will be able search 
the iTunes online list of albums, and select albums for my own list.
